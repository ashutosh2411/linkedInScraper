My name is Justin Posey. I am a public relations professional based in Washington, D.C. I have a unique combination
of public affairs and communications experience that allows me to not only diagnose problems, but also anticipate potential roadblocks and devise creative solutions to avoid them. In 2012, I graduated from The University of Alabama College of Communication and Information Sciences, recognized as one of the top five public relations programs by PRWeek Magazine each of the last six years. During my time at The Capstone, I not only learned from some of the industry s leading professionals but also put to work the skills and tactics they taught. As a student, I helped lead LessThanUThink, a national-award winning student-generated campaign that addressed the national issue of college age binge-drinking. Additionally, I honed my skills by being actively engaged in the Public Relations Student Society of America, Capstone Agency and other career preparatory organizations.
