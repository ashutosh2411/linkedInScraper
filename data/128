My experience as a professional communicator and press specialist is both broad and unique. For several years I
served in the United States Air Force as a public affairs officer, working at nationally known bases, including Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, handling press and public affairs for some of America's most dynamic aircraft. More recently, on the political side, I served as the press secretary for Concerned Veterans for America, where I managed national media outreach, working and building relationships with reporters who cover VA issues, the Department of Defense, federal spending and debt, and political news. I also edited content for CVA's blog, "The Overwatch," and handled press outreach for special events, including town halls with national policymakers like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.
