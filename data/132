My goal is to connect as many conservative professionals with career opportunities as possible in order to advance
the conservative cause. The Heritage Foundation is the conservative movement's leading think tank. As a recruiter, I work to acquire the best talent - from interns to managers - so that Heritage continues to lead the conservative movement by developing and promoting public policy solutions. The Heritage Job Bank engages thousands of job seekers through career seminars, twice-weekly emails with conservative job postings, and personal career consultations.
