I do two things REALLY well - I recruit people, and I organize events. I like to lead, I like to create, and I like to get
other people involved with me. Its been that way since I was a kid. Fortunately these two go hand-in-hand quite often. I went to school for Event Management - I wanted (and still do) to run the biggest sporting/ entertainment events on the planet - The Super Bowl, The Olympics, The Masters - these are my dreams (dream BIG). But the economy wasn't ripe for the event management profession in 2008, so I landed in my second best career... mostly by happenstance; through a friend (like most things in this world, it's about relationships). I'm really good at talking to people, sizing up their strengths and putting them in places where they can be most successful - this skill has led me down the path of a professional Recruiter. I run a full desk; part business development and part recruiting. So in my volunteer time I plan events - golf tournaments, banquets, conferences, fundraisers, while my day job keeps me busy recruiting the best-in-class for the MarTech industry - eCommerce, UX/ Cx, Analytics, Digital Marketing, and Front End Developers. I'm a self-starter with an entrepreneurial spirit. I thrive in a fast-paced environment; excelling at the point where autonomy is expected, and synergy is created, when smart/ motivated people work together towards a common goal. I enjoy business/volunteer opportunities that utilize and call upon my unique blend of talents, expertise, and energy, combined with my strong network. Please contact me to discuss how I can help foster the relationships between the right people and solutions, enabling your mission succeed.
