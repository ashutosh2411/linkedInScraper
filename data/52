As a corporate associate, I represented a variety of clients in various types of corporate transactions, including mergers, stock acquisitions, and asset purchases. I drafted diverse corporate documents, including transaction and closing documents, corporate governance documents, and standard form contracts.

While at Stoel, I specialized in creating and managing Public Benefit Corporations, a new type of entity available in many jurisdictions that allows and encourages profit-based corporations to consider the needs of the public and stakeholders as well as the monetary interests of shareholders.

I consistently leveraged my accounting and business background to more efficiently and effectively service client needs by understanding both legal and business issues.
