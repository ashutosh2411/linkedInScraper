I have always loved numbers and accounting. There is no better way to enjoy accounting than in the car business.
Developing efficient, collaborative, cross-trained office teams is one of my strengths. That is what allows the production of accurate, on-time financial statements. It is always a team effort. Hands on work in every department has given me the deep knowledge needed to protect dealership assets. I enjoy creating Excel spreadsheets and graphs to provide managers with the information they need to effectively manage their departments.
