I have worked in the restaurant industry for four years with a three month period where I took some time off and lived
in Montana. I am great with people, especially in the hospitality industry. I have a keen understanding as to what my job entails and I try to get it done with the best of my ability. I am a hard worker that will never fail to fall short of what is asked from me on a day to day basis. Also, working at a law firm opened a door to my law career by giving me the necessary tools to further progress my passion for the law.
