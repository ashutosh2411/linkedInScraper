I have become proficient with Microsoft Office and Yardi resident management software. I have developed strong
teamwork and leadership skills by working closely with other resident assistants to plan and execute community building programs in WMU residence halls. I have honed keen analytical and problem-solving skills due to overseeing the accounting processes of 4 apartment communities located in Michigan and Indiana.
